Your exam book should be called <student number>.pdf (e.g. 12345678.pdf) and be placed in this folder -- this is your exam book that will be graded. Any other new files may not be graded. Do not add new folders and please don't commit IDE files.

For the programming parts of the questions, update the code in the relevant folder.

Email mel.ocinneide@ucd.ie and deaglan.connolly-bree@ucdconnect.ie with any questions you have during the exam.
